///
/// # Behaviour
/// 1. Rejects zero-weight votes.
/// 2. Safely accumulates `weight` into `total_weight_accrued` via checked
///    addition, returning `Err(ConsensusError::WeightOverflow)` on overflow.
/// 3. Increments the vote counter with **saturating** arithmetic (never wraps).
/// 4. Sets `is_done = true` **if and only if** `total_weight_accrued >= threshold`
///    after the addition. `is_done` is never cleared once set.
///
/// # Invariants (proved by Kani harnesses in `verification/`)
/// * Resolution ↔ `total_weight_accrued >= threshold`
/// * No execution path sets `is_done` without meeting `threshold`
/// * `is_done` is monotonically set (never unset)
/// * `checked_add` prevents silent overflow
/// * `votes` saturates at `u32::MAX`
